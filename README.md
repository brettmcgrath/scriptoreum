## Project Contents:

Scriptoreum is a small news aggregation project I am starting for personal use. I enjoy reading cryptocurrency, stock, finance and economic news daily, but prefer to read it on my Kindle. This project aims to search various sources for pertinent articles of interest and aggregate them to an indexed PDF that can be emailed to my Kindle for daily news consumption. 


## Current Work:

I am currently working on general functionality. The largest problem of what I have created so far is that it will find anything and everything found by Google News, using only kewyword search. Eventually I aim to taylor this search down considerably through means of more targeted machine learning approaches.
